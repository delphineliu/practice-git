iWeb (released in 2018) contains about 14 billion words of text from an extremely broad range of websites. iWeb is one of only three corpora from the web that are 10 billion words in size or larger, and it is the only such corpus with carefully-corrected wordlists.  iWeb is about 25 times as large as COCA (the other main source for the word frequency data), and there are some important differences between the iWeb list and the COCA-based list.
This file is a sample data of word frequency based on one billion word COCA corpus with two lists:a lemmatized list and a "word forms" list.The sample data contains every tenth word in the 60,000 word lemmatized list).
